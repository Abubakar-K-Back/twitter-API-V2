# twitter-API-V2

This is Python Wrapper for Twitter-API-V2

You just have to enter the dates and account id (Please Enter Your Own API Keys).

This Script will generate tokens from V2-API and using each token it will fetch the tweets.

Twitter API V2 did not return full retweeted Text you have to run another API call (Send Tweet ID) to get the full retweeted Text

But this script will also fetch the full retweeted Text.

Recommend to use PyCharm.
